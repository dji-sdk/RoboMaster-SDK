.. function:: common_object.callback_register(event, callback)

    :description: The callback function triggered by the registered control event. When the control detects this event, the registered callback function is executed.

    :param string event: Specify the trigger event of the callback function

        The events that can be registered for each control are described as follows:

        * The Button control:
            - ``on_click``: Trigger this event when the button is released in the process of pressing and releasing the button once
            - ``on_press_down``: Trigger this event when the button is pressed
            - ``on_press_up``: Trigger this event when the button is released

        * The Toggle control:
            - Trigger this event when the value of ``on_value_changed`` changes. The args parameter in the callback function is a boolean value, which is the updated value of the Toggle control.

        * The Dropdown control:
            - Trigger this event when the value of ``on_value_changed`` changes. The args parameter in the callback function is an int value, which is the selected index entry after the value of the Toggle control changes.

        * The Text control:
            - No trigger events are available. 

        * The InputField control:
            - Trigger this event when the value of ``on_value_changed`` changes. The args parameter in the callback function is a string, which is the updated value of the InputField control.

    :param function callback: The callback function that needs to be registered. The unified signature of callback functions is ``def callback(widget,*args,**kw):``, where widget is the reference to the control that triggered the event, and args and kw are parameters.

    :return: None

    :example 1: 

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # When the my_Button control is clicked, the information will be output to the console, and the robot will shoot once.

    def button_callback(widget,*args,**kw):
        print("the button is clicked and the button's name is "+ widget.get_name())
        gun_ctrl.fire_once()
    my_Button.callback_register('on_click',button_callback)
..

    :example 2: 

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # When the my_Toggle control is clicked, the value of the control changes, the information is output to the console, and the robot will play a sound.

    def toggle_callback(widget,*args,**kw):
        print("the toggle's value is changed and the toggle's name is "+ widget.get_name())
        print("the toggle's value now is "+ str(args))
        media_ctrl.play_sound(rm_define.media_sound_recognize_success)
    my_Toggle.callback_register('on_value_changed',toggle_callback)
..

 :example 3: 

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # When you click the my_Dropdown control to change its selected value, the value changes, the information is output to the console, and the robot will play a sound.

    def dropdown_callback(widget,*args,**kw):
        print("the dropdown's value is changed and the dropdown's name is "+ widget.get_name())
        print("the dropdown's value now is "+ str(args))
        media_ctrl.play_sound(rm_define.media_sound_solmization_1A)
    my_Dropdown.callback_register('on_value_changed',dropdown_callback)
..

    :example 4: 

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # When you click the my_InputField control to change its selected value, the value changes, and the information is output to the console.

    def input_field_callback(widget,*args,**kw):
        print("the input_field's value is changed and the input_field's name is "+ widget.get_name())
        print("the input_field's value now is "+ str(args))
    my_InputField.callback_register('on_value_changed',input_field_callback)
